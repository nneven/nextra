# Nicolas Neven

Hi, I'm Nicolas Neven, a passionate computer scientist with a strong focus on full-stack development, machine learning, and blockchain technology. Currently, I am pursuing a progressive Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I've been involved in a wide array of projects and experiences, spanning across various industries.

My diverse background includes working as a full-stack software engineer at Nascent, an investment research analyst at Blueyard Capital, and even as an Artificial Intelligence Teaching Assistant at USC. I've had the opportunity to contribute to ground-breaking projects like Rari Capital's Charity Vaults and my own startup, NFTrees.

Technically proficient in Python, React, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Docker, and AWS/GCP DevOps, I am committed to leveraging my skills to drive innovation in the tech industry. Beyond my academic and professional accomplishments, I am an avid snowboarder and rock climber, which has allowed me to build resilience and develop a strong sense of adventure.

When I'm not working on cutting-edge projects or enjoying outdoor activities, I love connecting with people in the tech community and sharing my experiences. Please feel free to explore my GitHub portfolio, and if you're interested in connecting, reach out to me on LinkedIn. I am always excited to discuss new opportunities and collaborate on innovative solutions.

Hey, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Company. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.
