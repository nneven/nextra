# Nicolas Neven

Hi! I'm Nicolas Neven, an ambitious and creative computer scientist with a passion for full-stack development, machine learning, and blockchain technology. I'm currently pursuing my dual Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I am constantly immersing myself in cutting-edge technology.

Throughout my journey, I have gained invaluable experience in various roles, including a full-stack software engineer, investment research analyst, and artificial intelligence teaching assistant. One of my proudest accomplishments was co-founding NFTrees, a startup dedicated to tokenizing carbon credits and supporting reforestation efforts using NFTs.

In my downtime, you can find me exploring the great outdoorsâ€”snowboarding down the slopes, or conquering rock climbing challenges.
